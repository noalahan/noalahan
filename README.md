# Hello, I'm Noa! 👋
I am currently pursuing my BS Computer Science Degree in University of California, Santa Cruz. I have also recently spent a year studying abroad in the Creative Computing Institute 
at the Univeristy of the Arts London in England. I am currently applying to front-end development positions since I would love to pursue UX/web design.
